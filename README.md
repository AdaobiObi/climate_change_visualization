"# climate_change_visualization" 
Climate Change is one of the greatest threats to our existence as humans. This project creates some visualizations to show the change in global temperature and total greenhouse gas emissions over several years.
You might need to install the following packages to run the code:
!pip install folium
!pip install plotly
!pip install squarify
!pip install circlify
!pip install kaleido

Here's the link to an infographic I created using the visualization from this project - https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:18700652-91a9-47bf-857e-8df58437a7e1
